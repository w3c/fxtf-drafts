NAME
       curl - transfer a URL

SYNOPSIS
       curl [options] [URL...]

DESCRIPTION
       curl  is  a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the
       supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS,  SCP,  SFTP,  TFTP,  DICT,
       TELNET,  LDAP  or  FILE).  The command is designed to work without user
       interaction.

       curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authen-
       tication,  FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file trans-
       fer resume and more. As you will see below, the number of features will
       make your head spin!

       curl  is  powered  by  libcurl  for  all transfer-related features. See
       libcurl(3) for details.

URL
       The URL syntax is protocol-dependent. You'll find a  detailed  descrip-
       tion in RFC 3986.

       You  can  specify  multiple  URLs or parts of URLs by writing part sets
       within braces as in:

        http://site.{one,two,three}.com

       or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:

        ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt
        ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt    (with leading zeros)
        ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt

       No nesting of the sequences is supported at the moment, but you can use
       several ones next to each other:

        http://any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html

       You  can  specify  any amount of URLs on the command line. They will be
       fetched in a sequential manner in the specified order.

       Since curl 7.15.1 you can also specify a step counter for  the  ranges,
       so that you can get every Nth number or letter:

        http://www.numericals.com/file[1-100:10].txt
        http://www.letters.com/file[a-z:2].txt

       If  you  specify  URL  without protocol:// prefix, curl will attempt to
       guess what protocol you might want. It will then default  to  HTTP  but
       try  other  protocols based on often-used host name prefixes. For exam-
       ple, for host names starting with "ftp." curl will assume you  want  to
       speak FTP.

       curl  will  do  its best to use what you pass to it as a URL. It is not
       trying to validate it as a syntactically correct URL by any  means  but
       is instead very liberal with what it accepts.

       Curl will attempt to re-use connections for multiple file transfers, so
       that getting many files from the same server will not do multiple  con-
       nects / handshakes. This improves speed. Of course this is only done on
       files specified on a single command line and  cannot  be  used  between
       separate curl invokes.

PROGRESS METER
       curl  normally  displays a progress meter during operations, indicating
       the amount of transferred data,  transfer  speeds  and  estimated  time
       left, etc.

       However,  since  curl displays this data to the terminal by default, if
       you invoke curl to do an operation and it is about to write data to the
       terminal,  it disables the progress meter as otherwise it would mess up
       the output mixing progress meter and response data.

       If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to
       redirect  the  response  output to a file, using shell redirect (>), -o
       [file] or similar.

       It is not the same case for FTP upload as that operation does not  spit
       out any response data to the terminal.

       If you prefer a progress "bar" instead of the regular meter, -# is your
       friend.
OPTIONS
       In general, all boolean options are enabled with --option and yet again
       disabled  with --no-option. That is, you use the exact same option name
       but prefix it with "no-". However, in this list we mostly only list and
       show  the --option version of them. (This concept with --no options was
       added in  7.19.0.  Previously  most  options  were  toggled  on/off  on
       repeated use of the same command line option.)

       -a/--append
              (FTP/SFTP) When used in an upload, this will tell curl to append
              to the target file  instead  of  overwriting  it.  If  the  file
              doesn't  exist,  it  will  be  created.   Note that this flag is
              ignored by some SSH servers (including OpenSSH).

       -A/--user-agent <agent string>
              (HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server.
              Some   badly   done  CGIs  fail  if  this  field  isn't  set  to
              "Mozilla/4.0". To encode blanks  in  the  string,  surround  the
              string  with  single  quote marks. This can also be set with the
              -H/--header option of course.

              If this option is set more than once, the last one will  be  the
              one that's used.

       --anyauth
              (HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by itself,
              and use the most secure one the remote site claims  to  support.
              This is done by first doing a request and checking the response-
              headers, thus possibly inducing  an  extra  network  round-trip.
              This  is  used  instead  of  setting  a  specific authentication
              method, which you can do with  --basic,  --digest,  --ntlm,  and
              --negotiate.

              Note  that  using --anyauth is not recommended if you do uploads
              from stdin, since it may require data to be sent twice and  then
              the client must be able to rewind. If the need should arise when
              uploading from stdin, the upload operation will fail.

       -b/--cookie <name=data>
              (HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server as a cookie. It is  sup-
              posedly  the data previously received from the server in a "Set-
              Cookie:" line.  The data should be in the format  "NAME1=VALUE1;
              NAME2=VALUE2".

              If  no  '=' symbol is used in the line, it is treated as a file-
              name to use to read previously stored cookie lines  from,  which
              should  be used in this session if they match. Using this method
              also activates the "cookie parser" which will make  curl  record
              incoming cookies too, which may be handy if you're using this in
              combination with the -L/--location option. The  file  format  of
              the  file  to  read cookies from should be plain HTTP headers or
              the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format.

              NOTE that the file specified with -b/--cookie is  only  used  as
              input.  No cookies will be stored in the file. To store cookies,
              use the -c/--cookie-jar option or you could even save  the  HTTP
              headers to a file using -D/--dump-header!

              If  this  option is set more than once, the last one will be the
              one that's used.

       -B/--use-ascii
              Enable ASCII transfer when using FTP or LDAP. For FTP, this  can
              also  be enforced by using an URL that ends with ";type=A". This
              option causes data sent to stdout to be in text mode  for  win32
              systems.

       --basic
              (HTTP)  Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication. This is the
              default and this option is usually pointless, unless you use  it
              to  override  a  previously  set  option  that  sets a different
              authentication method (such as --ntlm,  --digest,  or  --negoti-
              ate).

       --ciphers <list of ciphers>
              (SSL) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection. The list
              of ciphers must specify valid ciphers. Read  up  on  SSL  cipher
              list           details           on           this          URL:
              http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html

              NSS ciphers are done differently than OpenSSL  and  GnuTLS.  The
              full  list of NSS ciphers is in the NSSCipherSuite entry at this
              URL: http://directory.fedora.redhat.com/docs/mod_nss.html#Direc-
              tives

              If this option is used several times, the last one will override
              the others.

       --compressed
              (HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms
              libcurl supports, and return the uncompressed document.  If this
              option is used and the server  sends  an  unsupported  encoding,
              curl will report an error.

       --connect-timeout <seconds>
              Maximum  time  in  seconds  that you allow the connection to the
              server to take.  This only limits  the  connection  phase,  once
              curl  has  connected this option is of no more use. See also the
              -m/--max-time option.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -c/--cookie-jar <file name>
              Specify to which file you want curl to write all cookies after a
              completed  operation.  Curl  writes  all cookies previously read
              from a specified file as  well  as  all  cookies  received  from
              remote server(s). If no cookies are known, no file will be writ-
              ten. The file will be written using  the  Netscape  cookie  file
              format.  If  you  set  the  file name to a single dash, "-", the
              cookies will be written to stdout.

              NOTE If the cookie jar can't be created or written to, the whole
              curl operation won't fail or even report an error clearly. Using
              -v will get a warning displayed, but that is  the  only  visible
              feedback you get about this possibly lethal situation.

              If  this  option  is used several times, the last specified file
              name will be used.

       -C/--continue-at <offset>
              Continue/Resume a previous file transfer at  the  given  offset.
              The  given  offset  is  the  exact  number of bytes that will be
              skipped, counting from the beginning of the source  file  before
              it is transferred to the destination.  If used with uploads, the
              FTP server command SIZE will not be used by curl.

              Use "-C -" to tell curl to automatically find out  where/how  to
              resume  the  transfer. It then uses the given output/input files
              to figure that out.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --create-dirs
              When used in conjunction with the -o option,  curl  will  create
              the  necessary  local directory hierarchy as needed. This option
              creates the dirs mentioned with the -o option, nothing else.  If
              the  -o file name uses no dir or if the dirs it mentions already
              exist, no dir will be created.

              To create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try  --ftp-
              create-dirs.

       --crlf (FTP) Convert LF to CRLF in upload. Useful for MVS (OS/390).

       --crlfile <file>
              (HTTPS/FTPS)  Provide a file using PEM format with a Certificate
              Revocation List that may specify peer certificates that  are  to
              be considered revoked.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              (Added in 7.19.7)

       -d/--data <data>
              (HTTP)  Sends  the  specified data in a POST request to the HTTP
              server, in the same way that a browser  does  when  a  user  has
              filled  in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This will
              cause curl to pass the data to the server using the content-type
              application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  Compare to -F/--form.

              -d/--data  is  the  same  as  --data-ascii.  To post data purely
              binary, you should instead use the --data-binary option. To URL-
              encode the value of a form field you may use --data-urlencode.

              If  any of these options is used more than once on the same com-
              mand line, the data pieces specified  will  be  merged  together
              with  a  separating  &-symbol.  Thus,  using  '-d name=daniel -d
              skill=lousy'  would  generate  a  post  chunk  that  looks  like
              'name=daniel&skill=lousy'.

              If  you  start  the data with the letter @, the rest should be a
              file name to read the data from, or - if you want curl  to  read
              the  data  from stdin.  The contents of the file must already be
              URL-encoded. Multiple files can also be specified. Posting  data
              from  a file named 'foobar' would thus be done with --data @foo-
              bar.

       --data-binary <data>
              (HTTP) This posts data exactly as specified with no  extra  pro-
              cessing whatsoever.

              If  you  start  the data with the letter @, the rest should be a
              filename.  Data is posted in a similar  manner  as  --data-ascii
              does,  except  that  newlines  are preserved and conversions are
              never done.

              If this option is used several times,  the  ones  following  the
              first will append data as described in -d/--data.

       --data-urlencode <data>
              (HTTP) This posts data, similar to the other --data options with
              the exception that this performs URL-encoding. (Added in 7.18.0)
              To be CGI-compliant, the <data> part should begin  with  a  name
              followed  by a separator and a content specification. The <data>
              part can be passed to curl using one of the following syntaxes:

              content
                     This will make curl URL-encode the content and pass  that
                     on.  Just  be careful so that the content doesn't contain
                     any = or @ symbols, as that will  then  make  the  syntax
                     match one of the other cases below!

              =content
                     This  will make curl URL-encode the content and pass that
                     on. The preceding = symbol is not included in the data.

              name=content
                     This will make curl URL-encode the content part and  pass
                     that  on.  Note that the name part is expected to be URL-
                     encoded already.

              @filename
                     This will  make  curl  load  data  from  the  given  file
                     (including  any  newlines), URL-encode that data and pass
                     it on in the POST.

              name@filename
                     This will  make  curl  load  data  from  the  given  file
                     (including  any  newlines), URL-encode that data and pass
                     it on in the POST. The  name  part  gets  an  equal  sign
                     appended, resulting in name=urlencoded-file-content. Note
                     that the name is expected to be URL-encoded already.

       --digest
              (HTTP) Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This is a authentica-
              tion that prevents the password from being sent over the wire in
              clear text. Use this in combination with  the  normal  -u/--user
              option to set user name and password. See also --ntlm, --negoti-
              ate and --anyauth for related options.

              If this option is used several times, the following  occurrences
              make no difference.

       --disable-eprt
              (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands
              when doing active FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first
              attempt  to use EPRT, then LPRT before using PORT, but with this
              option, it will use PORT right away. EPRT and  LPRT  are  exten-
              sions  to  the  original  FTP  protocol, and may not work on all
              servers, but they enable more functionality in a better way than
              the traditional PORT command.

              Since  curl 7.19.0, --eprt can be used to explicitly enable EPRT
              again and --no-eprt is an alias for --disable-eprt.

              Disabling EPRT only changes the active behavior. If you want  to
              switch  to  passive  mode  you  need to not use -P/--ftp-port or
              force it with --ftp-pasv.

       --disable-epsv
              (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use  of  the  EPSV  command  when
              doing  passive  FTP  transfers.  Curl will normally always first
              attempt to use EPSV before PASV, but with this option,  it  will
              not try using EPSV.

              Since  curl 7.19.0, --epsv can be used to explicitly enable EPRT
              again and --no-epsv is an alias for --disable-epsv.

              Disabling EPSV only changes the passive behavior. If you want to
              switch to active mode you need to use -P/--ftp-port.

       -D/--dump-header <file>
              Write the protocol headers to the specified file.

              This  option  is handy to use when you want to store the headers
              that a HTTP site sends to you. Cookies from  the  headers  could
              then   be  read  in  a  second  curl  invocation  by  using  the
              -b/--cookie option! The -c/--cookie-jar option is however a bet-
              ter way to store cookies.

              When  used  in FTP, the FTP server response lines are considered
              being "headers" and thus are saved there.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -e/--referer <URL>
              (HTTP) Sends the "Referer Page" information to the HTTP  server.
              This  can also be set with the -H/--header flag of course.  When
              used with -L/--location you can append ";auto" to the  --referer
              URL to make curl automatically set the previous URL when it fol-
              lows a Location: header. The ";auto" string can be  used  alone,
              even if you don't set an initial --referer.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --engine <name>
              Select  the  OpenSSL crypto engine to use for cipher operations.
              Use --engine list  to  print  a  list  of  build-time  supported
              engines.  Note  that  not  all  (or  none) of the engines may be
              available at run-time.

       --environment
              (RISC OS ONLY) Sets a range of environment variables, using  the
              names the -w option supports, to allow easier extraction of use-
              ful information after having run curl.

       --egd-file <file>
              (SSL) Specify the path name  to  the  Entropy  Gathering  Daemon
              socket.  The  socket  is  used to seed the random engine for SSL
              connections. See also the --random-file option.

       -E/--cert <certificate[:password]>
              (SSL) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file when get-
              ting  a  file with HTTPS or FTPS. The certificate must be in PEM
              format.  If the optional password isn't specified,  it  will  be
              queried  for  on  the  terminal. Note that this option assumes a
              "certificate" file that is the private key and the private  cer-
              tificate  concatenated!  See  --cert  and  --key to specify them
              independently.

              If curl is built against the NSS SSL library  then  this  option
              tells curl the nickname of the certificate to use within the NSS
              database defined by the  environment  variable  SSL_DIR  (or  by
              default  /etc/pki/nssdb).  If  the  NSS PEM PKCS#11 module (lib-
              nsspem.so) is available then PEM files may be loaded.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --cert-type <type>
              (SSL) Tells curl what certificate type the provided  certificate
              is in. PEM, DER and ENG are recognized types.  If not specified,
              PEM is assumed.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --cacert <CA certificate>
              (SSL) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify
              the  peer.  The  file  may contain multiple CA certificates. The
              certificate(s) must be in PEM format. Normally curl is built  to
              use a default file for this, so this option is typically used to
              alter that default file.

              curl recognizes the environment variable named  'CURL_CA_BUNDLE'
              if  it  is  set,  and uses the given path as a path to a CA cert
              bundle. This option overrides that variable.

              The windows version of curl will automatically  look  for  a  CA
              certs file named 'curl-ca-bundle.crt', either in the same direc-
              tory as curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory, or in any
              folder along your PATH.

              If  curl  is  built against the NSS SSL library then this option
              tells curl the nickname of the CA certificate to use within  the
              NSS  database defined by the environment variable SSL_DIR (or by
              default /etc/pki/nssdb).  If the NSS PEM  PKCS#11  module  (lib-
              nsspem.so) is available then PEM files may be loaded.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --capath <CA certificate directory>
              (SSL)  Tells  curl to use the specified certificate directory to
              verify the peer. The certificates must be in PEM format, and the
              directory  must  have  been processed using the c_rehash utility
              supplied with openssl. Using --capath can  allow  curl  to  make
              SSL-connections much more efficiently than using --cacert if the
              --cacert file contains many CA certificates.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -f/--fail
              (HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all) on server  errors.  This
              is  mostly done to better enable scripts etc to better deal with
              failed attempts. In normal cases when a  HTTP  server  fails  to
              deliver  a  document,  it  returns  an  HTML document stating so
              (which often also describes why and more). This flag  will  pre-
              vent curl from outputting that and return error 22.

              This  method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where non-
              successful response codes will  slip  through,  especially  when
              authentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).

       --ftp-account [data]
              (FTP) When an FTP server asks for "account data" after user name
              and password has been provided, this data is sent off using  the
              ACCT command. (Added in 7.13.0)

              If  this option is used twice, the second will override the pre-
              vious use.

       --ftp-create-dirs
              (FTP/SFTP) When an FTP or SFTP URL/operation uses  a  path  that
              doesn't  currently exist on the server, the standard behavior of
              curl is to fail. Using this option, curl will instead attempt to
              create missing directories.

       --ftp-method [method]
              (FTP)  Control  what method curl should use to reach a file on a
              FTP(S) server. The method argument should be one of the  follow-
              ing alternatives:

              multicwd
                     curl  does  a  single CWD operation for each path part in
                     the given URL. For deep hierarchies this means very  many
                     commands.  This  is  how  RFC1738 says it should be done.
                     This is the default but the slowest behavior.

              nocwd  curl does no CWD at all. curl will do  SIZE,  RETR,  STOR
                     etc and give a full path to the server for all these com-
                     mands. This is the fastest behavior.

              singlecwd
                     curl does one CWD with the full target directory and then
                     operates  on  the  file  "normally" (like in the multicwd
                     case). This is somewhat  more  standards  compliant  than
                     'nocwd' but without the full penalty of 'multicwd'.
       (Added in 7.15.1)

       --ftp-pasv
              (FTP)  Use  passive  mode for the data conection. Passive is the
              internal default behavior, but using this option can be used  to
              override a previous -P/-ftp-port option. (Added in 7.11.0)

              If  this option is used several times, the following occurrences
              make no difference. Undoing an  enforced  passive  really  isn't
              doable  but  you must then instead enforce the correct -P/--ftp-
              port again.

              Passive mode means that curl will try the EPSV command first and
              then PASV, unless --disable-epsv is used.

       --ftp-alternative-to-user <command>
              (FTP)  If  authenticating with the USER and PASS commands fails,
              send this  command.   When  connecting  to  Tumbleweed's  Secure
              Transport  server  over  FTPS  using a client certificate, using
              "SITE AUTH" will tell the server to retrieve the  username  from
              the certificate. (Added in 7.15.5)

       --ftp-skip-pasv-ip
              (FTP) Tell curl to not use the IP address the server suggests in
              its response to curl's PASV command when curl connects the  data
              connection.  Instead  curl  will  re-use  the same IP address it
              already uses for the control connection. (Added in 7.14.2)

              This option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used  instead
              of PASV.

       --ftp-pret
              (FTP)  Tell  curl to send a PRET command before PASV (and EPSV).
              Certain FTP servers, mainly drftpd,  require  this  non-standard
              command  for  directory  listings as well as up and downloads in
              PASV mode.  (Added in 7.20.x)

       --ssl  (FTP, POP3, IMAP, SMTP) Try to use SSL/TLS for  the  connection.
              Reverts to a non-secure connection if the server doesn't support
              SSL/TLS.  See also --ftp-ssl-control and --ssl-reqd for  differ-
              ent levels of encryption required. (Added in 7.20.0)

              This  option  was  formerly known as --ftp-ssl (Added in 7.11.0)
              and that can still be used but will be removed in a future  ver-
              sion.

       --ftp-ssl-control
              (FTP)  Require  SSL/TLS  for  the FTP login, clear for transfer.
              Allows secure authentication, but non-encrypted  data  transfers
              for  efficiency.   Fails the transfer if the server doesn't sup-
              port SSL/TLS.  (Added in 7.16.0)

       --ssl-reqd
              (FTP, POP3, IMAP, SMTP)  Require  SSL/TLS  for  the  connection.
              Terminates the connection if the server doesn't support SSL/TLS.
              (Added in 7.20.0)

              This option was  formerly  known  as  --ftp-ssl-reqd  (added  in
              7.15.5)  and  that  can  still  be used but will be removed in a
              future version.

       --ftp-ssl-ccc
              (FTP) Use CCC (Clear Command Channel)  Shuts  down  the  SSL/TLS
              layer after authenticating. The rest of the control channel com-
              munication will be unencrypted. This allows NAT routers to  fol-
              low the FTP transaction. The default mode is passive. See --ftp-
              ssl-ccc-mode for other modes.  (Added in 7.16.1)

       --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode [active/passive]
              (FTP) Use CCC (Clear Command Channel) Sets  the  CCC  mode.  The
              passive  mode  will  not initiate the shutdown, but instead wait
              for the server to do it, and will not reply to the shutdown from
              the server. The active mode initiates the shutdown and waits for
              a reply from the server.  (Added in 7.16.2)

       -F/--form <name=content>
              (HTTP) This lets curl emulate a filled-in form in which  a  user
              has  pressed  the  submit  button. This causes curl to POST data
              using the Content-Type multipart/form-data according to RFC2388.
              This  enables  uploading of binary files etc. To force the 'con-
              tent' part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @ sign. To
              just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with
              the symbol <. The difference between @ and  <  is  then  that  @
              makes  a  file  get attached in the post as a file upload, while
              the < makes a text field and just get the contents for that text
              field from a file.

              Example,  to send your password file to the server, where 'pass-
              word' is the name of the form-field to which /etc/passwd will be
              the input:

              curl -F password=@/etc/passwd www.mypasswords.com

              To  read  the file's content from stdin instead of a file, use -
              where the file name should've been. This goes for both @  and  <
              constructs.

              You  can  also  tell  curl  what  Content-Type  to  use by using
              'type=', in a manner similar to:

              curl -F "web=@index.html;type=text/html" url.com

              or

              curl -F "name=daniel;type=text/foo" url.com

              You can also explicitly change the name field of an file  upload
              part by setting filename=, like this:

              curl -F "file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost" url.com

              See further examples and details in the MANUAL.

              This option can be used multiple times.

       --form-string <name=string>
              (HTTP)  Similar  to  --form except that the value string for the
              named parameter is used literally. Leading '@' and  '<'  charac-
              ters, and the ';type=' string in the value have no special mean-
              ing. Use this in preference to --form if there's any possibility
              that  the  string  value may accidentally trigger the '@' or '<'
              features of --form.

       -g/--globoff
              This option switches off the "URL globbing parser". When you set
              this  option, you can specify URLs that contain the letters {}[]
              without having them being interpreted by curl itself. Note  that
              these  letters are not normal legal URL contents but they should
              be encoded according to the URI standard.

       -G/--get
              When used,  this  option  will  make  all  data  specified  with
              -d/--data  or  --data-binary  to  be  used in a HTTP GET request
              instead of the POST request that otherwise would  be  used.  The
              data will be appended to the URL with a '?' separator.

              If  used  in  combination with -I, the POST data will instead be
              appended to the URL with a HEAD request.

              If this option is used several times, the following  occurrences
              make  no  difference. This is because undoing a GET doesn't make
              sense, but you  should  then  instead  enforce  the  alternative
              method you prefer.

       -h/--help
              Usage help.

       -H/--header <header>
              (HTTP)  Extra  header  to  use  when getting a web page. You may
              specify any number of extra headers. Note that if you should add
              a  custom  header  that has the same name as one of the internal
              ones curl would use, your externally set  header  will  be  used
              instead of the internal one. This allows you to make even trick-
              ier stuff than curl would normally do. You  should  not  replace
              internally  set  headers  without  knowing  perfectly  well what
              you're doing. Remove an internal header by giving a  replacement
              without  content  on  the  right  side  of  the colon, as in: -H
              "Host:".

              curl will make sure that each header  you  add/replace  is  sent
              with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus not add that
              as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage
              returns, they will only mess things up for you.

              See also the -A/--user-agent and -e/--referer options.

              This  option  can  be  used multiple times to add/replace/remove
              multiple headers.

       --hostpubmd5 <md5>
              Pass a string  containing  32  hexadecimal  digits.  The  string
              should  be  the 128 bit MD5 checksum of the remote host's public
              key, curl will refuse the connection with the  host  unless  the
              md5sums  match.  This option is only for SCP and SFTP transfers.
              (Added in 7.17.1)

       --ignore-content-length
              (HTTP) Ignore the Content-Length header.  This  is  particularly
              useful  for servers running Apache 1.x, which will report incor-
              rect Content-Length for files larger than 2 gigabytes.

       -i/--include
              (HTTP) Include the HTTP-header in the  output.  The  HTTP-header
              includes  things  like  server-name, date of the document, HTTP-
              version and more...

       --interface <name>
              Perform an operation using a specified interface. You can  enter
              interface  name,  IP address or host name. An example could look
              like:

               curl --interface eth0:1 http://www.netscape.com/

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -I/--head
              (HTTP/FTP/FILE) Fetch the HTTP-header only! HTTP-servers feature
              the  command  HEAD which this uses to get nothing but the header
              of a document. When used on a FTP or FILE  file,  curl  displays
              the file size and last modification time only.

       -j/--junk-session-cookies
              (HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given file, this
              option will make it discard all  "session  cookies".  This  will
              basically  have  the same effect as if a new session is started.
              Typical browsers always discard  session  cookies  when  they're
              closed down.

       -J/--remote-header-name
              (HTTP)  This option tells the -O/--remote-name option to use the
              server-specified   Content-Disposition   filename   instead   of
              extracting a filename from the URL.

       -k/--insecure
              (SSL)  This  option explicitly allows curl to perform "insecure"
              SSL connections and transfers. All SSL connections are attempted
              to  be  made secure by using the CA certificate bundle installed
              by default. This makes  all  connections  considered  "insecure"
              fail unless -k/--insecure is used.

              See     this    online    resource    for    further    details:
              http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

       --keepalive-time <seconds>
              This option sets the time a  connection  needs  to  remain  idle
              before  sending keepalive probes and the time between individual
              keepalive probes. It is currently effective on operating systems
              offering  the  TCP_KEEPIDLE  and  TCP_KEEPINTVL  socket  options
              (meaning Linux, recent AIX, HP-UX and more). This option has  no
              effect if --no-keepalive is used. (Added in 7.18.0)

              If  this option is used multiple times, the last occurrence sets
              the amount.
       --key <key>
              (SSL/SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your pri-
              vate key in this separate file.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --key-type <type>
              (SSL)  Private key file type. Specify which type your --key pro-
              vided private key is. DER, PEM, and ENG are  supported.  If  not
              specified, PEM is assumed.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --krb <level>
              (FTP)  Enable Kerberos authentication and use. The level must be
              entered and should be one of 'clear', 'safe', 'confidential', or
              'private'.  Should  you  use  a  level that is not one of these,
              'private' will instead be used.

              This option requires a library built with  kerberos4  or  GSSAPI
              (GSS-Negotiate)  support. This is not very common. Use -V/--ver-
              sion to see if your curl supports it.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -K/--config <config file>
              Specify which config file to read curl arguments from. The  con-
              fig  file  is a text file in which command line arguments can be
              written which then will be used as if they were written  on  the
              actual command line. Options and their parameters must be speci-
              fied on the same config  file  line,  separated  by  whitespace,
              colon,  the equals sign or any combination thereof (however, the
              preferred separator is the equals sign). If the parameter is  to
              contain  whitespace,  the  parameter  must  be  enclosed  within
              quotes. Within double quotes, the following escape sequences are
              available:  \\, \", \t, \n, \r and \v. A backslash preceding any
              other letter is ignored. If the first column of a config line is
              a  '#' character, the rest of the line will be treated as a com-
              ment. Only write one option per  physical  line  in  the  config
              file.

              Specify the filename to -K/--config as '-' to make curl read the
              file from stdin.

              Note that to be able to specify a URL in the  config  file,  you
              need  to  specify  it  using the --url option, and not by simply
              writing the URL on its own line. So, it could  look  similar  to
              this:

              url = "http://curl.haxx.se/docs/"

              Long  option  names  can  optionally be given in the config file
              without the initial double dashes.

              When curl is invoked, it always (unless -q is used) checks for a
              default  config  file  and  uses it if found. The default config
              file is checked for in the following places in this order:

              1) curl tries to find the "home dir": It first  checks  for  the
              CURL_HOME and then the HOME environment variables. Failing that,
              it uses getpwuid() on UNIX-like systems (which returns the  home
              dir  given the current user in your system). On Windows, it then
              checks for the APPDATA variable, or as a last resort the '%USER-
              PROFILE%\Application Data'.

              2)  On  windows, if there is no _curlrc file in the home dir, it
              checks for one in the same dir the curl executable is placed. On
              UNIX-like  systems,  it will simply try to load .curlrc from the
              determined home dir.

              # --- Example file ---
              # this is a comment
              url = "curl.haxx.se"
              output = "curlhere.html"
              user-agent = "superagent/1.0"

              # and fetch another URL too
              url = "curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html"
              -O
              referer = "http://nowhereatall.com/"
              # --- End of example file ---

              This option can be used multiple times to load  multiple  config
              files.

       --libcurl <file>
              Append  this  option  to any ordinary curl command line, and you
              will get a libcurl-using source code written to  the  file  that
              does the equivalent of what your command-line operation does!

              NOTE:  this does not properly support -F and the sending of mul-
              tipart formposts, so in those cases the output program  will  be
              missing necessary calls to curl_formadd(3), and possibly more.

              If  this  option is used several times, the last given file name
              will be used. (Added in 7.16.1)

       --limit-rate <speed>
              Specify the maximum transfer rate you want  curl  to  use.  This
              feature is useful if you have a limited pipe and you'd like your
              transfer not to use your entire bandwidth.

              The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix  is
              appended.   Appending  'k' or 'K' will count the number as kilo-
              bytes, 'm' or M' makes it megabytes, while 'g' or 'G'  makes  it
              gigabytes. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.

              The  given  rate  is the average speed counted during the entire
              transfer. It means that curl might use higher transfer speeds in
              short bursts, but over time it uses no more than the given rate.
              If  you  also  use the -Y/--speed-limit option, that option will
              take precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting slightly, to
              help keeping the speed-limit logic working.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -l/--list-only
              (FTP)  When listing an FTP directory, this switch forces a name-
              only view.  Especially useful if you want to  machine-parse  the
              contents  of  an  FTP  directory since the normal directory view
              doesn't use a standard look or format.

              This option causes an FTP NLST command to  be  sent.   Some  FTP
              servers  list  only files in their response to NLST; they do not
              include subdirectories and symbolic links.

       --local-port <num>[-num]
              Set a preferred number or range of local port numbers to use for
              the  connection(s).   Note  that  port  numbers  by nature are a
              scarce resource that will be busy at times so setting this range
              to something too narrow might cause unnecessary connection setup
              failures. (Added in 7.15.2)

       -L/--location
              (HTTP/HTTPS) If the server reports that the requested  page  has
              moved to a different location (indicated with a Location: header
              and a 3XX response code), this option will make  curl  redo  the
              request  on the new place. If used together with -i/--include or
              -I/--head, headers from all requested pages will be shown.  When
              authentication  is  used, curl only sends its credentials to the
              initial host. If a redirect takes curl to a different  host,  it
              won't  be  able to intercept the user+password. See also --loca-
              tion-trusted on how to change this. You can limit the amount  of
              redirects to follow by using the --max-redirs option.

              When  curl follows a redirect and the request is not a plain GET
              (for example POST or PUT), it will do the following request with
              a GET if the HTTP response was 301, 302, or 303. If the response
              code was any other 3xx code, curl  will  re-send  the  following
              request using the same unmodified method.

       --location-trusted
              (HTTP/HTTPS) Like -L/--location, but will allow sending the name
              + password to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This  may
              or may not introduce a security breach if the site redirects you
              to a site to which you'll send your authentication  info  (which
              is plaintext in the case of HTTP Basic authentication).

       --mail-rcpt <address>
              (SMTP)  Specify  a single address that the given mail should get
              sent to. This option can be used multiple times to specify  many
              recipients.

              (Added in 7.20.0)

       --mail-from <address>
              (SMTP)  Specify  a single address that the given mail should get
              sent from.

              (Added in 7.20.0)

       --max-filesize <bytes>
              Specify the maximum size (in bytes) of a file  to  download.  If
              the  file requested is larger than this value, the transfer will
              not start and curl will return with exit code 63.

              NOTE: The file size is not always known prior to  download,  and
              for such files this option has no effect even if the file trans-
              fer ends up being larger than this given  limit.  This  concerns
              both FTP and HTTP transfers.

       -m/--max-time <seconds>
              Maximum  time  in  seconds that you allow the whole operation to
              take.  This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from  hang-
              ing  for  hours  due  to slow networks or links going down.  See
              also the --connect-timeout option.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -M/--manual
              Manual. Display the huge help text.

       -n/--netrc
              Makes curl scan the .netrc  (_netrc  on  Windows)  file  in  the
              user's home directory for login name and password. This is typi-
              cally used for FTP on UNIX. If used with HTTP, curl will  enable
              user  authentication.  See netrc(4) or ftp(1) for details on the
              file format. Curl will not complain if that  file  doesn't  have
              the  right permissions (it should not be either world- or group-
              readable). The environment variable "HOME" is used to  find  the
              home directory.

              A  quick  and  very  simple  example of how to setup a .netrc to
              allow curl to FTP to the machine host.domain.com with user  name
              'myself' and password 'secret' should look similar to:

              machine host.domain.com login myself password secret

       --netrc-optional
              Very  similar to --netrc, but this option makes the .netrc usage
              optional and not mandatory as the --netrc option does.

       --negotiate
              (HTTP) Enables GSS-Negotiate authentication.  The  GSS-Negotiate
              method was designed by Microsoft and is used in their web appli-
              cations. It is  primarily  meant  as  a  support  for  Kerberos5
              authentication but may be also used along with another authenti-
              cation method. For more information see IETF draft draft-brezak-
              spnego-http-04.txt.

              If  you  want to enable Negotiate for your proxy authentication,
              then use --proxy-negotiate.

              This option requires a library built with GSSAPI  support.  This
              is not very common. Use -V/--version to see if your version sup-
              ports GSS-Negotiate.

              When using this option, you must also provide a  fake  -u/--user
              option  to  activate the authentication code properly. Sending a
              '-u :' is enough as the user  name  and  password  from  the  -u
              option aren't actually used.

              If  this option is used several times, the following occurrences
              make no difference.

       -N/--no-buffer
              Disables the buffering of the output stream. In normal work sit-
              uations,  curl  will  use a standard buffered output stream that
              will have the effect that it will output the data in chunks, not
              necessarily  exactly  when  the data arrives.  Using this option
              will disable that buffering.

              Note that this is the negated option name  documented.  You  can
              thus use --buffer to enforce the buffering.

       --no-keepalive
              Disables the use of keepalive messages on the TCP connection, as
              by default curl enables them.

              Note that this is the negated option name  documented.  You  can
              thus use --keepalive to enforce keepalive.

       --no-sessionid
              (SSL)  Disable curl's use of SSL session-ID caching.  By default
              all transfers are done using the cache. Note that while  nothing
              should  ever  get  hurt  by attempting to reuse SSL session-IDs,
              there seem to be broken SSL implementations in the wild that may
              require  you to disable this in order for you to succeed. (Added
              in 7.16.0)

              Note that this is the negated option name  documented.  You  can
              thus use --sessionid to enforce session-ID caching.

       --noproxy <no-proxy-list>
              Comma-separated  list  of hosts which do not use a proxy, if one
              is specified.  The only wildcard is a single * character,  which
              matches all hosts, and effectively disables the proxy. Each name
              in this list is matched as either a domain  which  contains  the
              hostname,  or  the hostname itself. For example, local.com would
              match  local.com,  local.com:80,  and  www.local.com,  but   not
              www.notlocal.com.  (Added in 7.19.4).

       --ntlm (HTTP)  Enables  NTLM  authentication.  The  NTLM authentication
              method was designed by Microsoft and is used by IIS web servers.
              It  is a proprietary protocol, reverse-engineered by clever peo-
              ple and implemented in curl based on their efforts. This kind of
              behavior  should  not be endorsed, you should encourage everyone
              who uses NTLM to switch to a public and  documented  authentica-
              tion method instead, such as Digest.

              If  you  want to enable NTLM for your proxy authentication, then
              use --proxy-ntlm.

              This option requires a  library  built  with  SSL  support.  Use
              -V/--version to see if your curl supports NTLM.

              If  this option is used several times, the following occurrences
              make no difference.

       -o/--output <file>
              Write output to <file> instead of stdout. If you are using {} or
              []  to  fetch  multiple documents, you can use '#' followed by a
              number in the <file> specifier. That variable will  be  replaced
              with the current string for the URL being fetched. Like in:

                curl http://{one,two}.site.com -o "file_#1.txt"

              or use several variables like:

                curl http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o "#1_#2"

              You  may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you
              have.

              See also the --create-dirs option to create the  local  directo-
              ries  dynamically.  Specifying the output as '-' (a single dash)
              will force the output to be done to stdout.

       -O/--remote-name
              Write output to a local file named like the remote file we  get.
              (Only  the file part of the remote file is used, the path is cut
              off.)

              The remote file name to use for saving  is  extracted  from  the
              given URL, nothing else.

              You  may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you
              have.

       --remote-name-all
              This option changes the default action for all given URLs to  be
              dealt  with as if -O/--remote-name were used for each one. So if
              you want to disable that for a specific URL after --remote-name-
              all  has  been  used,  you  must use "-o -" or --no-remote-name.
              (Added in 7.19.0)

       --pass <phrase>
              (SSL/SSH) Passphrase for the private key

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --post301
              Tells curl to respect  RFC  2616/10.3.2  and  not  convert  POST
              requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection. The
              non-RFC behaviour is ubiquitous in web browsers,  so  curl  does
              the  conversion  by  default to maintain consistency. However, a
              server may require a POST to remain a POST after  such  a  redi-
              rection. This option is meaningful only when using -L/--location
              (Added in 7.17.1)

       --post302
              Tells curl to respect  RFC  2616/10.3.2  and  not  convert  POST
              requests into GET requests when following a 302 redirection. The
              non-RFC behaviour is ubiquitous in web browsers,  so  curl  does
              the  conversion  by  default to maintain consistency. However, a
              server may require a POST to remain a POST after  such  a  redi-
              rection. This option is meaningful only when using -L/--location
              (Added in 7.19.1)

       --proxy-anyauth
              Tells curl to pick a suitable authentication method when  commu-
              nicating  with  the  given  proxy.  This  might  cause  an extra
              request/response round-trip. (Added in 7.13.2)

       --proxy-basic
              Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication  when  communicating
              with the given proxy. Use --basic for enabling HTTP Basic with a
              remote host. Basic is the  default  authentication  method  curl
              uses with proxies.

       --proxy-digest
              Tells  curl to use HTTP Digest authentication when communicating
              with the given proxy. Use --digest for enabling HTTP Digest with
              a remote host.

       --proxy-negotiate
              Tells curl to use HTTP Negotiate authentication when communicat-
              ing with the given proxy.  Use  --negotiate  for  enabling  HTTP
              Negotiate with a remote host. (Added in 7.17.1)

       --proxy-ntlm
              Tells  curl  to  use HTTP NTLM authentication when communicating
              with the given proxy. Use --ntlm for enabling NTLM with a remote
              host.

       --proxy1.0 <proxyhost[:port]>
              Use  the  specified  HTTP  1.0  proxy. If the port number is not
              specified, it is assumed at port 1080.

              The only difference between  this  and  the  HTTP  proxy  option
              (-x/--proxy),  is that attempts to use CONNECT through the proxy
              will specify an HTTP 1.0 protocol instead of  the  default  HTTP
              1.1.

       -p/--proxytunnel
              When  an HTTP proxy is used (-x/--proxy), this option will cause
              non-HTTP protocols  to  attempt  to  tunnel  through  the  proxy
              instead  of merely using it to do HTTP-like operations. The tun-
              nel approach is made with the HTTP  proxy  CONNECT  request  and
              requires that the proxy allows direct connect to the remote port
              number curl wants to tunnel through to.

       --pubkey <key>
              (SSH) Public key file name. Allows you to  provide  your  public
              key in this separate file.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -P/--ftp-port <address>
              (FTP)  Reverses  the  default initiator/listener roles when con-
              necting with FTP. This switch makes curl  use  active  mode.  In
              practice,  curl  then  tells  the  server to connect back to the
              client's specified address and port, while passive mode asks the
              server  to  setup  an  IP address and port for it to connect to.
              <address> should be one of:

              interface
                     i.e "eth0" to specify which interface's  IP  address  you
                     want to use (Unix only)

              IP address
                     i.e "192.168.10.1" to specify the exact IP address

              host name
                     i.e "my.host.domain" to specify the machine

              -      make  curl  pick the same IP address that is already used
                     for the control connection

       If this option is used several times, the last one will be  used.  Dis-
       able  the  use  of PORT with --ftp-pasv. Disable the attempt to use the
       EPRT command instead of PORT by using --disable-eprt.  EPRT  is  really
       PORT++.

       Starting in 7.19.5, you can append ":[start]-[end]" to the right of the
       address, to tell curl what TCP port range to use. That means you  spec-
       ify  a  port  range,  from  a lower to a higher number. A single number
       works as well, but do note that it increases the risk of failure  since
       the port may not be available.

       -q     If  used  as the first parameter on the command line, the curlrc
              config file will not be read and used. See the  -K/--config  for
              details on the default config file search path.

       -Q/--quote <command>
              (FTP/SFTP)  Send  an arbitrary command to the remote FTP or SFTP
              server. Quote commands are sent BEFORE the transfer takes  place
              (just  after  the  initial PWD command in an FTP transfer, to be
              exact). To make commands take place after a successful transfer,
              prefix  them  with  a  dash '-'.  To make commands be sent after
              libcurl has changed  the  working  directory,  just  before  the
              transfer command(s), prefix the command with a '+' (this is only
              supported for FTP). You may specify any number of  commands.  If
              the  server  returns failure for one of the commands, the entire
              operation will be aborted. You must send  syntactically  correct
              FTP  commands  as  RFC959  defines to FTP servers, or one of the
              commands listed below to SFTP servers.  This option can be  used
              multiple times.

              SFTP  is  a  binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, libcurl interprets
              SFTP quote commands before sending them to the server.   Follow-
              ing is the list of all supported SFTP quote commands:

              chgrp group file
                     The  chgrp command sets the group ID of the file named by
                     the file operand to the group ID specified by  the  group
                     operand. The group operand is a decimal integer group ID.

              chmod mode file
                     The  chmod  command  modifies  the  file mode bits of the
                     specified file. The mode operand is an octal integer mode
                     number.

              chown user file
                     The chown command sets the owner of the file named by the
                     file operand to the user ID specified by the  user  oper-
                     and. The user operand is a decimal integer user ID.

              ln source_file target_file
                     The ln and symlink commands create a symbolic link at the
                     target_file location pointing to  the  source_file  loca-
                     tion.

              mkdir directory_name
                     The  mkdir  command  creates  the  directory named by the
                     directory_name operand.

              pwd    The pwd command returns the absolute pathname of the cur-
                     rent working directory.

              rename source target
                     The rename command renames the file or directory named by
                     the source operand to the destination path named  by  the
                     target operand.

              rm file
                     The rm command removes the file specified by the file op-
                     erand.

              rmdir directory
                     The rmdir command removes the directory  entry  specified
                     by the directory operand, provided it is empty.

              symlink source_file target_file
                     See ln.

       --random-file <file>
              (SSL) Specify the path name to file containing what will be con-
              sidered as random data. The data is  used  to  seed  the  random
              engine for SSL connections.  See also the --egd-file option.

       -r/--range <range>
              (HTTP/FTP/SFTP/FILE)  Retrieve a byte range (i.e a partial docu-
              ment) from a HTTP/1.1, FTP or  SFTP  server  or  a  local  FILE.
              Ranges can be specified in a number of ways.

              0-499     specifies the first 500 bytes

              500-999   specifies the second 500 bytes

              -500      specifies the last 500 bytes

              9500-     specifies the bytes from offset 9500 and forward

              0-0,-1    specifies the first and last byte only(*)(H)

              500-700,600-799
                        specifies 300 bytes from offset 500(H)

              100-199,500-599
                        specifies two separate 100-byte ranges(*)(H)

       (*)  =  NOTE  that this will cause the server to reply with a multipart
       response!

       Only digit characters (0-9) are valid in the 'start' and 'stop'  fields
       of  the 'start-stop' range syntax. If a non-digit character is given in
       the range, the server's response will be unspecified, depending on  the
       server's configuration.

       You  should  also  be aware that many HTTP/1.1 servers do not have this
       feature enabled, so that when  you  attempt  to  get  a  range,  you'll
       instead get the whole document.

       FTP  and SFTP range downloads only support the simple 'start-stop' syn-
       tax (optionally with one of the numbers omitted). FTP  use  depends  on
       the extended FTP command SIZE.

       If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --raw  When  used, it disables all internal HTTP decoding of content or
              transfer encodings and instead makes them passed  on  unaltered,
              raw. (Added in 7.16.2)

       -R/--remote-time
              When  used,  this  will  make  libcurl attempt to figure out the
              timestamp of the remote file, and if that is available make  the
              local file get that same timestamp.

       --retry <num>
              If  a  transient  error is returned when curl tries to perform a
              transfer, it will retry this number of times before  giving  up.
              Setting  the  number to 0 makes curl do no retries (which is the
              default). Transient error means either: a timeout,  an  FTP  4xx
              response code or an HTTP 5xx response code.

              When  curl  is about to retry a transfer, it will first wait one
              second and then for all forthcoming retries it will  double  the
              waiting  time until it reaches 10 minutes which then will be the
              delay between the rest of the retries.  By  using  --retry-delay
              you   disable  this  exponential  backoff  algorithm.  See  also
              --retry-max-time to limit the total time  allowed  for  retries.
              (Added in 7.12.3)

              If  this  option  is  used  multiple  times, the last occurrence
              decide the amount.

       --retry-delay <seconds>
              Make curl sleep this amount of time before  each  retry  when  a
              transfer  has  failed  with  a  transient  error (it changes the
              default backoff time algorithm between retries). This option  is
              only  interesting if --retry is also used. Setting this delay to
              zero will make curl use the default  backoff  time.   (Added  in
              7.12.3)

              If  this  option  is  used  multiple  times, the last occurrence
              determines the amount.

       --retry-max-time <seconds>
              The retry timer is reset  before  the  first  transfer  attempt.
              Retries will be done as usual (see --retry) as long as the timer
              hasn't reached this given limit. Notice that if the timer hasn't
              reached  the  limit, the request will be made and while perform-
              ing, it may take longer than this given time period. To limit  a
              single  request's  maximum  time,  use  -m/--max-time.  Set this
              option to zero to not timeout retries. (Added in 7.12.3)

              If this option is  used  multiple  times,  the  last  occurrence
              determines the amount.

       -s/--silent
              Silent  or  quiet  mode. Don't show progress meter or error mes-
              sages.  Makes Curl mute.

       -S/--show-error
              When used with -s it makes curl show  an  error  message  if  it
              fails.

       --socks4 <host[:port]>
              Use the specified SOCKS4 proxy. If the port number is not speci-
              fied, it is assumed at port 1080. (Added in 7.15.2)

              This option overrides any previous use of  -x/--proxy,  as  they
              are mutually exclusive.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --socks4a <host[:port]>
              Use the specified SOCKS4a proxy. If the port number is not spec-
              ified, it is assumed at port 1080. (Added in 7.18.0)

              This option overrides any previous use of  -x/--proxy,  as  they
              are mutually exclusive.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --socks5-hostname <host[:port]>
              Use  the  specified  SOCKS5 proxy (and let the proxy resolve the
              host name). If the port number is not specified, it  is  assumed
              at port 1080. (Added in 7.18.0)

              This  option  overrides  any previous use of -x/--proxy, as they
              are mutually exclusive.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
              (This  option  was  previously  wrongly  documented  and used as
              --socks without the number appended.)

       --socks5 <host[:port]>
              Use the specified SOCKS5 proxy  -  but  resolve  the  host  name
              locally.  If  the port number is not specified, it is assumed at
              port 1080.

              This option overrides any previous use of  -x/--proxy,  as  they
              are mutually exclusive.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
              (This option was  previously  wrongly  documented  and  used  as
              --socks without the number appended.)

              This  option (as well as --socks4) does not work with IPV6, FTPS
              or LDAP.

       --socks5-gssapi-service <servicename>
              The default service name for a socks server is rcmd/server-fqdn.
              This option allows you to change it.

              Examples:
               --socks5  proxy-name  --socks5-gssapi-service sockd   would use
              sockd/proxy-name
               --socks5  proxy-name  --socks5-gssapi-service   sockd/real-name
              would  use  sockd/real-name  for cases where the proxy-name does
              not match the princpal name.
               (Added in 7.19.4).

       --socks5-gssapi-nec
              As part of the gssapi negotiation a protection mode  is  negoti-
              ated.  The  rfc1961  says  in  section 4.3/4.4 it should be pro-
              tected, but the NEC  reference  implementation  does  not.   The
              option  --socks5-gssapi-nec  allows  the unprotected exchange of
              the protection mode negotiation. (Added in 7.19.4).

       --stderr <file>
              Redirect all writes to stderr to the specified file instead.  If
              the  file  name is a plain '-', it is instead written to stdout.
              This option has no point when you're using a shell  with  decent
              redirecting capabilities.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --tcp-nodelay
              Turn  on the TCP_NODELAY option. See the curl_easy_setopt(3) man
              page for details about this option. (Added in 7.11.2)

       -t/--telnet-option <OPT=val>
              Pass options to the telnet protocol. Supported options are:

              TTYPE=<term> Sets the terminal type.

              XDISPLOC=<X display> Sets the X display location.

              NEW_ENV=<var,val> Sets an environment variable.

       --tftp-blksize <value>
              (TFTP) Set TFTP BLKSIZE option (must be >512). This is the block
              size  that curl will try to use when tranferring data to or from
              a TFTP server. By default 512 bytes will be used.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              (Added in 7.20.0)

       -T/--upload-file <file>
              This transfers the specified local file to the  remote  URL.  If
              there is no file part in the specified URL, Curl will append the
              local file name. NOTE that you must use a trailing / on the last
              directory  to really prove to Curl that there is no file name or
              curl will think that your last directory name is the remote file
              name to use. That will most likely cause the upload operation to
              fail. If this is used on a HTTP(S) server, the PUT command  will
              be used.

              Use  the file name "-" (a single dash) to use stdin instead of a
              given file.  Alternately, the file name "."  (a  single  period)
              may  be  specified  instead  of "-" to use stdin in non-blocking
              mode to  allow  reading  server  output  while  stdin  is  being
              uploaded.

              You can specify one -T for each URL on the command line. Each -T
              + URL pair specifies what to upload and to where. curl also sup-
              ports "globbing" of the -T argument, meaning that you can upload
              multiple files to a single URL by using the  same  URL  globbing
              style supported in the URL, like this:

              curl -T "{file1,file2}" http://www.uploadtothissite.com

              or even

              curl -T "img[1-1000].png" ftp://ftp.picturemania.com/upload/

       --trace <file>
              Enables  a  full  trace  dump of all incoming and outgoing data,
              including descriptive information, to the given output file. Use
              "-" as filename to have the output sent to stdout.

              This  option overrides previous uses of -v/--verbose or --trace-
              ascii.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --trace-ascii <file>
              Enables a full trace dump of all  incoming  and  outgoing  data,
              including descriptive information, to the given output file. Use
              "-" as filename to have the output sent to stdout.

              This is very similar to --trace, but leaves out the hex part and
              only  shows  the ASCII part of the dump. It makes smaller output
              that might be easier to read for untrained humans.

              This option overrides previous uses of -v/--verbose or --trace.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --trace-time
              Prepends a time stamp to each trace or verbose  line  that  curl
              displays.  (Added in 7.14.0)

       -u/--user <user:password>
              Specify the user name and password to use for server authentica-
              tion. Overrides -n/--netrc and --netrc-optional.

              If you just give the user name (without entering a  colon)  curl
              will prompt for a password.

              If  you  use an SSPI-enabled curl binary and do NTLM authentica-
              tion, you can force curl to pick up the user name  and  password
              from  your  environment by simply specifying a single colon with
              this option: "-u :".

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -U/--proxy-user <user:password>
              Specify the user name and password to use for proxy  authentica-
              tion.

              If  you  use an SSPI-enabled curl binary and do NTLM authentica-
              tion, you can force curl to pick up the user name  and  password
              from  your  environment by simply specifying a single colon with
              this option: "-U :".

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --url <URL>
              Specify a URL to fetch. This option is  mostly  handy  when  you
              want to specify URL(s) in a config file.

              This  option  may  be used any number of times. To control where
              this URL is written, use the -o/--output or the -O/--remote-name
              options.

       -v/--verbose
              Makes  the  fetching  more  verbose/talkative. Mostly useful for
              debugging. A line starting with '>' means "header data" sent  by
              curl, '<' means "header data" received by curl that is hidden in
              normal cases, and a line starting with '*' means additional info
              provided by curl.

              Note  that  if  you  only  want  HTTP  headers  in  the  output,
              -i/--include might be the option you're looking for.

              If you think this option still doesn't give you enough  details,
              consider using --trace or --trace-ascii instead.

              This option overrides previous uses of --trace-ascii or --trace.

              Use -S/--silent to make curl quiet.

       -V/--version
              Displays information about curl and the libcurl version it uses.
              The  first  line  includes the full version of curl, libcurl and
              other 3rd party libraries linked with the executable.

              The second line (starts with "Protocols:") shows  all  protocols
              that libcurl reports to support.

              The third line (starts with "Features:") shows specific features
              libcurl reports to offer. Available features include:

              IPv6   You can use IPv6 with this.

              krb4   Krb4 for FTP is supported.

              SSL    HTTPS and FTPS are supported.

              libz   Automatic decompression of compressed files over HTTP  is
                     supported.

              NTLM   NTLM authentication is supported.

              GSS-Negotiate
                     Negotiate authentication and krb5 for FTP is supported.

              Debug  This  curl  uses a libcurl built with Debug. This enables
                     more error-tracking and memory debugging etc.  For  curl-
                     developers only!

              AsynchDNS
                     This curl uses asynchronous name resolves.

              SPNEGO SPNEGO Negotiate authentication is supported.

              Largefile
                     This curl supports transfers of large files, files larger
                     than 2GB.

              IDN    This curl supports IDN - international domain names.

              SSPI   SSPI is supported. If you use NTLM and set a  blank  user
                     name,  curl  will authenticate with your current user and
                     password.

       -w/--write-out <format>
              Defines what to display on stdout after a completed and success-
              ful  operation.  The  format  is a string that may contain plain
              text mixed with any number of variables. The string can be spec-
              ified  as "string", to get read from a particular file you spec-
              ify it "@filename" and to tell curl  to  read  the  format  from
              stdin you write "@-".

              The  variables  present in the output format will be substituted
              by the value or text that curl thinks fit, as  described  below.
              All  variables are specified as %{variable_name} and to output a
              normal % you just write them as %%. You can output a newline  by
              using \n, a carriage return with \r and a tab space with \t.

              NOTE: The %-symbol is a special symbol in the win32-environment,
              where all occurrences of %  must  be  doubled  when  using  this
              option.

              The variables available at this point are:

              url_effective  The URL that was fetched last. This is most mean-
                             ingful if you've told curl  to  follow  location:
                             headers.

              http_code      The numerical response code that was found in the
                             last retrieved HTTP(S)  or  FTP(s)  transfer.  In
                             7.18.2  the alias response_code was added to show
                             the same info.

              http_connect   The numerical code that was  found  in  the  last
                             response   (from  a  proxy)  to  a  curl  CONNECT
                             request. (Added in 7.12.4)

              time_total     The total time, in seconds, that the full  opera-
                             tion lasted. The time will be displayed with mil-
                             lisecond resolution.

              time_namelookup
                             The time, in seconds,  it  took  from  the  start
                             until the name resolving was completed.

              time_connect   The  time,  in  seconds,  it  took from the start
                             until the TCP connect  to  the  remote  host  (or
                             proxy) was completed.

              time_appconnect
                             The  time,  in  seconds,  it  took from the start
                             until the SSL/SSH/etc  connect/handshake  to  the
                             remote host was completed. (Added in 7.19.0)

              time_pretransfer
                             The  time,  in  seconds,  it  took from the start
                             until the file transfer was just about to  begin.
                             This includes all pre-transfer commands and nego-
                             tiations that are specific to the particular pro-
                             tocol(s) involved.

              time_redirect  The time, in seconds, it took for all redirection
                             steps include name lookup,  connect,  pretransfer
                             and  transfer  before  the  final transaction was
                             started. time_redirect shows the complete  execu-
                             tion  time  for  multiple redirections. (Added in
                             7.12.3)

              time_starttransfer
                             The time, in seconds,  it  took  from  the  start
                             until  the first byte was just about to be trans-
                             ferred. This includes time_pretransfer  and  also
                             the  time  the  server  needed  to  calculate the
                             result.

              size_download  The total amount of bytes that were downloaded.

              size_upload    The total amount of bytes that were uploaded.

              size_header    The total amount of bytes of the downloaded head-
                             ers.

              size_request   The  total  amount of bytes that were sent in the
                             HTTP request.

              speed_download The average download speed that curl measured for
                             the complete download. Bytes per second.

              speed_upload   The  average  upload speed that curl measured for
                             the complete upload. Bytes per second.

              content_type   The Content-Type of the  requested  document,  if
                             there was any.

              num_connects   Number  of new connects made in the recent trans-
                             fer. (Added in 7.12.3)

              num_redirects  Number of redirects that  were  followed  in  the
                             request. (Added in 7.12.3)

              redirect_url   When a HTTP request was made without -L to follow
                             redirects, this variable will show the actual URL
                             a redirect would take you to. (Added in 7.18.2)

              ftp_entry_path The initial path libcurl ended up in when logging
                             on to the remote FTP server. (Added in 7.15.4)

              ssl_verify_result
                             The result of the SSL peer certificate  verifica-
                             tion that was requested. 0 means the verification
                             was successful. (Added in 7.19.0)

       If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -x/--proxy <proxyhost[:port]>
              Use the specified HTTP proxy. If the port number is  not  speci-
              fied, it is assumed at port 1080.

              This  option  overrides  existing environment variables that set
              the proxy to use. If there's an environment variable  setting  a
              proxy, you can set proxy to "" to override it.

              Note  that  all  operations that are performed over a HTTP proxy
              will transparently be converted to HTTP. It means  that  certain
              protocol specific operations might not be available. This is not
              the case if you can tunnel through the proxy, as done  with  the
              -p/--proxytunnel option.

              Starting  with 7.14.1, the proxy host can be specified the exact
              same way as the proxy environment variables, including the  pro-
              tocol prefix (http://) and the embedded user + password.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -X/--request <command>
              (HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicat-
              ing with the HTTP server.  The specified request  will  be  used
              instead  of  the  method otherwise used (which defaults to GET).
              Read the HTTP 1.1 specification for  details  and  explanations.
              Common  additional  HTTP  requests  include  PUT and DELETE, but
              related technologies like WebDAV offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE and
              more.

              (FTP) Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of LIST when
              doing file lists with FTP.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -y/--speed-time <time>
              If a download is slower than speed-limit bytes per second during
              a speed-time period, the download gets aborted. If speed-time is
              used, the default speed-limit will be 1 unless set with -Y.

              This option controls transfers and thus  will  not  affect  slow
              connects  etc.  If this is a concern for you, try the --connect-
              timeout option.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -Y/--speed-limit <speed>
              If a download is slower than this given speed (in bytes per sec-
              ond)  for  speed-time seconds it gets aborted. speed-time is set
              with -y and is 30 if not set.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -z/--time-cond <date expression>
              (HTTP/FTP) Request a file that has been modified later than  the
              given  time  and date, or one that has been modified before that
              time. The date expression can be all sorts of date strings or if
              it  doesn't  match  any  internal ones, it tries to get the time
              from a given file name  instead!  See  the  curl_getdate(3)  man
              pages for date expression details.

              Start the date expression with a dash (-) to make it request for
              a document that is older than the given date/time, default is  a
              document that is newer than the specified date/time.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --max-redirs <num>
              Set   maximum   number  of  redirection-followings  allowed.  If
              -L/--location is used, this option can be used to  prevent  curl
              from following redirections "in absurdum". By default, the limit
              is set to 50 redirections. Set this option to -1 to make it lim-
              itless.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -0/--http1.0
              (HTTP)  Forces curl to issue its requests using HTTP 1.0 instead
              of using its internally preferred: HTTP 1.1.

       -1/--tlsv1
              (SSL) Forces curl to use TLS version 1 when negotiating  with  a
              remote TLS server.

       -2/--sslv2
              (SSL)  Forces  curl to use SSL version 2 when negotiating with a
              remote SSL server.

       -3/--sslv3
              (SSL) Forces curl to use SSL version 3 when negotiating  with  a
              remote SSL server.

       -4/--ipv4
              If  libcurl  is  capable  of resolving an address to multiple IP
              versions (which it is if it is IPv6-capable), this option  tells
              libcurl to resolve names to IPv4 addresses only.

       -6/--ipv6
              If  libcurl  is  capable  of resolving an address to multiple IP
              versions (which it is if it is IPv6-capable), this option  tells
              libcurl to resolve names to IPv6 addresses only.

       -#/--progress-bar
              Make curl display progress information as a progress bar instead
              of the default statistics.

FILES
       ~/.curlrc
              Default config file, see -K/--config for details.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variables can be specified in lower case or upper case.
       The lower case version has precedence. http_proxy is an exception as it
       is only available in lower case.

       http_proxy [protocol://]<host>[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use for HTTP.
       HTTPS_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use for HTTPS.

       FTP_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use for FTP.

       ALL_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use if no  protocol-specific  proxy  is
              set.

       NO_PROXY <comma-separated list of hosts>
              list  of  host names that shouldn't go through any proxy. If set
              to a asterisk '*' only, it matches all hosts.

EXIT CODES
       There are a bunch of different  error  codes  and  their  corresponding
       error  messages  that  may appear during bad conditions. At the time of
       this writing, the exit codes are:

       1      Unsupported protocol. This build of curl has no support for this
              protocol.

       2      Failed to initialize.

       3      URL malformed. The syntax was not correct.

       5      Couldn't  resolve  proxy.  The  given  proxy  host  could not be
              resolved.

       6      Couldn't resolve host. The given remote host was not resolved.

       7      Failed to connect to host.

              parse.

       9      FTP  access  denied. The server denied login or denied access to
              the particular resource or directory you wanted to  reach.  Most
              often  you  tried to change to a directory that doesn't exist on
              the server.

       11     FTP weird PASS reply. Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to  the
              PASS request.

       13     FTP  weird PASV reply, Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to the
              PASV request.

       14     FTP weird 227 format.  Curl  couldn't  parse  the  227-line  the
              server sent.

              lar) command failed.

       21     FTP quote error. A quote command returned error from the server.
       22     HTTP page not retrieved. The requested  url  was  not  found  or
              returned  another  error  with  the HTTP error code being 400 or
              above. This return code only appears if -f/--fail is used.

       23     Write error. Curl couldn't write data to a local  filesystem  or
              similar.

       25     FTP  couldn't  STOR  file. The server denied the STOR operation,
              used for FTP uploading.

              support the PORT  command,  try  doing  a  transfer  using  PASV
              instead!

       31     FTP  couldn't use REST. The REST command failed. This command is
              used for resumed FTP transfers.

       33     HTTP range error. The range "command" didn't work.

       34     HTTP post error. Internal post-request generation error.

       35     SSL connect error. The SSL handshaking failed.

            scp://shell.example.com/~/personal.txt

  Get the main page from an IPv6 web server:

        curl -g "http://[2001:1890:1112:1::20]/"

DOWNLOAD TO A FILE

  Get a web page and store in a local file:

        curl -o thatpage.html http://www.netscape.com/

  Get a web page and store in a local file, make the local file get the name
  of the remote document (if no file name part is specified in the URL, this
  will fail):

        curl -O http://www.netscape.com/index.html

  Fetch two files and store them with their remote names:

        curl -O www.haxx.se/index.html -O curl.haxx.se/download.html

USING PASSWORDS

 FTP

   To ftp files using name+passwd, include them in the URL like:

        curl ftp://name:passwd@machine.domain:port/full/path/to/file

   or specify them with the -u flag like

        curl -u name:passwd ftp://machine.domain:port/full/path/to/file

 FTPS

   It is just like for FTP, but you may also want to specify and use
   SSL-specific options for certificates etc.

   Note that using FTPS:// as prefix is the "implicit" way as described in the
   standards while the recommended "explicit" way is done by using FTP:// and
   the --ftp-ssl option.

 SFTP / SCP

   This is similar to FTP, but you can specify a private key to use instead of
   a password. Note that the private key may itself be protected by a password
   that is unrelated to the login password of the remote system.  If you
   provide a private key file you must also provide a public key file.

 HTTP

   Curl also supports user and password in HTTP URLs, thus you can pick a file
   like:

        curl http://name:passwd@machine.domain/full/path/to/file

   or specify user and password separately like in

        curl -u name:passwd http://machine.domain/full/path/to/file

   HTTP offers many different methods of authentication and curl supports
   several: Basic, Digest, NTLM and Negotiate. Without telling which method to
   use, curl defaults to Basic. You can also ask curl to pick the most secure
   ones out of the ones that the server accepts for the given URL, by using
   --anyauth.

   NOTE! Since HTTP URLs don't support user and password, you can't use that
   style when using Curl via a proxy. You _must_ use the -u style fetch
   during such circumstances.

 HTTPS

   Probably most commonly used with private certificates, as explained below.

PROXY

 Get an ftp file using a proxy named my-proxy that uses port 888:

        curl -x my-proxy:888 ftp://ftp.leachsite.com/README

 Get a file from a HTTP server that requires user and password, using the
 same proxy as above:

        curl -u user:passwd -x my-proxy:888 http://www.get.this/

 Some proxies require special authentication. Specify by using -U as above:

        curl -U user:passwd -x my-proxy:888 http://www.get.this/

 A comma-separated list of hosts and domains which do not use the proxy can
 be specified as:

        curl --noproxy localhost,get.this -x my-proxy:888 http://www.get.this/

 If the proxy is specified with --proxy1.0 instead of --proxy or -x, then
 curl will use HTTP/1.0 instead of HTTP/1.1 for any CONNECT attempts.

 curl also supports SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies with --socks4 and --socks5.

 See also the environment variables Curl support that offer further proxy
 control.

RANGES

  With HTTP 1.1 byte-ranges were introduced. Using this, a client can request
  to get only one or more subparts of a specified document. Curl supports
  this with the -r flag.

  Get the first 100 bytes of a document:

        curl -r 0-99 http://www.get.this/

  Get the last 500 bytes of a document:

        curl -r -500 http://www.get.this/

  Curl also supports simple ranges for FTP files as well. Then you can only
  specify start and stop position.

  Get the first 100 bytes of a document using FTP:

        curl -r 0-99 ftp://www.get.this/README

UPLOADING

 FTP / FTPS / SFTP / SCP

  Upload all data on stdin to a specified server:

        curl -T - ftp://ftp.upload.com/myfile

  Upload data from a specified file, login with user and password:

        curl -T uploadfile -u user:passwd ftp://ftp.upload.com/myfile

  Upload a local file to the remote site, and use the local file name remote
  too:

        curl -T uploadfile -u user:passwd ftp://ftp.upload.com/

  Upload a local file to get appended to the remote file:

        curl -T localfile -a ftp://ftp.upload.com/remotefile

  Curl also supports ftp upload through a proxy, but only if the proxy is
  configured to allow that kind of tunneling. If it does, you can run curl in
  a fashion similar to:

        curl --proxytunnel -x proxy:port -T localfile ftp.upload.com

 HTTP

  Upload all data on stdin to a specified http site:

        curl -T - http://www.upload.com/myfile

  Note that the http server must have been configured to accept PUT before
  this can be done successfully.

  For other ways to do http data upload, see the POST section below.

VERBOSE / DEBUG

  If curl fails where it isn't supposed to, if the servers don't let you in,
  if you can't understand the responses: use the -v flag to get verbose
  fetching. Curl will output lots of info and what it sends and receives in
  order to let the user see all client-server interaction (but it won't show
  you the actual data).

        curl -v ftp://ftp.upload.com/

  To get even more details and information on what curl does, try using the
  --trace or --trace-ascii options with a given file name to log to, like
  this:

        curl --trace trace.txt www.haxx.se


DETAILED INFORMATION

  Different protocols provide different ways of getting detailed information
  about specific files/documents. To get curl to show detailed information
  about a single file, you should use -I/--head option. It displays all
  available info on a single file for HTTP and FTP. The HTTP information is a
  lot more extensive.

  For HTTP, you can get the header information (the same as -I would show)
  shown before the data by using -i/--include. Curl understands the
  -D/--dump-header option when getting files from both FTP and HTTP, and it
  will then store the headers in the specified file.

  Store the HTTP headers in a separate file (headers.txt in the example):

        curl --dump-header headers.txt curl.haxx.se

  Note that headers stored in a separate file can be very useful at a later
  time if you want curl to use cookies sent by the server. More about that in
  the cookies section.

POST (HTTP)

  It's easy to post data using curl. This is done using the -d <data>
  option.  The post data must be urlencoded.

  Post a simple "name" and "phone" guestbook.

        curl -d "name=Rafael%20Sagula&phone=3320780" \
                http://www.where.com/guest.cgi

  How to post a form with curl, lesson #1:

  Dig out all the <input> tags in the form that you want to fill in. (There's
  a perl program called formfind.pl on the curl site that helps with this).

  If there's a "normal" post, you use -d to post. -d takes a full "post
  string", which is in the format

        <variable1>=<data1>&<variable2>=<data2>&...

  The 'variable' names are the names set with "name=" in the <input> tags, and
  the data is the contents you want to fill in for the inputs. The data *must*
  be properly URL encoded. That means you replace space with + and that you
  write weird letters with %XX where XX is the hexadecimal representation of
  the letter's ASCII code.

  Example:

  (page located at http://www.formpost.com/getthis/

        <form action="post.cgi" method="post">
        <input name=user size=10>
        <input name=pass type=password size=10>
        <input name=id type=hidden value="blablabla">
        <input name=ding value="submit">
        </form>

  We want to enter user 'foobar' with password '12345'.

  To post to this, you enter a curl command line like:

        curl -d "user=foobar&pass=12345&id=blablabla&ding=submit"  (continues)
          http://www.formpost.com/getthis/post.cgi


  While -d uses the application/x-www-form-urlencoded mime-type, generally
  understood by CGI's and similar, curl also supports the more capable
  multipart/form-data type. This latter type supports things like file upload.

  -F accepts parameters like -F "name=contents". If you want the contents to
  be read from a file, use <@filename> as contents. When specifying a file,
  you can also specify the file content type by appending ';type=<mime type>'
  to the file name. You can also post the contents of several files in one
  field.  For example, the field name 'coolfiles' is used to send three files,
  with different content types using the following syntax:

        curl -F "coolfiles=@fil1.gif;type=image/gif,fil2.txt,fil3.html" \
        http://www.post.com/postit.cgi

  If the content-type is not specified, curl will try to guess from the file
  extension (it only knows a few), or use the previously specified type (from
  an earlier file if several files are specified in a list) or else it will
  using the default type 'text/plain'.

  Emulate a fill-in form with -F. Let's say you fill in three fields in a
  form. One field is a file name which to post, one field is your name and one
  field is a file description. We want to post the file we have written named
  "cooltext.txt". To let curl do the posting of this data instead of your
  favourite browser, you have to read the HTML source of the form page and
  find the names of the input fields. In our example, the input field names
  are 'file', 'yourname' and 'filedescription'.

        curl -F "file=@cooltext.txt" -F "yourname=Daniel" \
             -F "filedescription=Cool text file with cool text inside" \
             http://www.post.com/postit.cgi

  To send two files in one post you can do it in two ways:

  1. Send multiple files in a single "field" with a single field name:

        curl -F "pictures=@dog.gif,cat.gif"

  2. Send two fields with two field names:

        curl -F "docpicture=@dog.gif" -F "catpicture=@cat.gif"

  To send a field value literally without interpreting a leading '@'
  or '<', or an embedded ';type=', use --form-string instead of
  -F. This is recommended when the value is obtained from a user or
  some other unpredictable source. Under these circumstances, using
  -F instead of --form-string would allow a user to trick curl into
  uploading a file.

REFERRER

  A HTTP request has the option to include information about which address
  that referred to actual page.  Curl allows you to specify the
  referrer to be used on the command line. It is especially useful to
  fool or trick stupid servers or CGI scripts that rely on that information
  being available or contain certain data.

        curl -e www.coolsite.com http://www.showme.com/

  NOTE: The Referer: [sic] field is defined in the HTTP spec to be a full URL.

USER AGENT

  A HTTP request has the option to include information about the browser
  that generated the request. Curl allows it to be specified on the command
  line. It is especially useful to fool or trick stupid servers or CGI
  scripts that only accept certain browsers.

  Example:

  curl -A 'Mozilla/3.0 (Win95; I)' http://www.nationsbank.com/

  Other common strings:
    'Mozilla/3.0 (Win95; I)'     Netscape Version 3 for Windows 95
    'Mozilla/3.04 (Win95; U)'    Netscape Version 3 for Windows 95
    'Mozilla/2.02 (OS/2; U)'     Netscape Version 2 for OS/2
    'Mozilla/4.04 [en] (X11; U; AIX 4.2; Nav)'           NS for AIX
    'Mozilla/4.05 [en] (X11; U; Linux 2.0.32 i586)'      NS for Linux

  Note that Internet Explorer tries hard to be compatible in every way:
    'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.01; Windows 95)'    MSIE for W95

  Mozilla is not the only possible User-Agent name:
    'Konqueror/1.0'             KDE File Manager desktop client
    'Lynx/2.7.1 libwww-FM/2.14' Lynx command line browser

COOKIES

  Cookies are generally used by web servers to keep state information at the
  client's side. The server sets cookies by sending a response line in the
  headers that looks like 'Set-Cookie: <data>' where the data part then
  typically contains a set of NAME=VALUE pairs (separated by semicolons ';'
  like "NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2;"). The server can also specify for what
  path the "cookie" should be used for (by specifying "path=value"), when the
  cookie should expire ("expire=DATE"), for what domain to use it
  ("domain=NAME") and if it should be used on secure connections only
  ("secure").

  If you've received a page from a server that contains a header like:
        Set-Cookie: sessionid=boo123; path="/foo";

  it means the server wants that first pair passed on when we get anything in
  a path beginning with "/foo".

  Example, get a page that wants my name passed in a cookie:

        curl -b "name=Daniel" www.sillypage.com

  Curl also has the ability to use previously received cookies in following
  sessions. If you get cookies from a server and store them in a file in a
  manner similar to:

        curl --dump-header headers www.example.com

  ... you can then in a second connect to that (or another) site, use the
  cookies from the 'headers' file like:

        curl -b headers www.example.com

  While saving headers to a file is a working way to store cookies, it is
  however error-prone and not the preferred way to do this. Instead, make curl
  save the incoming cookies using the well-known netscape cookie format like
  this:

        curl -c cookies.txt www.example.com

  Note that by specifying -b you enable the "cookie awareness" and with -L
  you can make curl follow a location: (which often is used in combination
  with cookies). So that if a site sends cookies and a location, you can
  use a non-existing file to trigger the cookie awareness like:

        curl -L -b empty.txt www.example.com

  The file to read cookies from must be formatted using plain HTTP headers OR
  as netscape's cookie file. Curl will determine what kind it is based on the
  file contents.  In the above command, curl will parse the header and store
  the cookies received from www.example.com.  curl will send to the server the
  stored cookies which match the request as it follows the location.  The
  file "empty.txt" may be a nonexistent file.

  Alas, to both read and write cookies from a netscape cookie file, you can
  set both -b and -c to use the same file:

        curl -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt www.example.com

PROGRESS METER

  The progress meter exists to show a user that something actually is
  happening. The different fields in the output have the following meaning:

  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed          Time             Curr.
                                 Dload  Upload Total    Current  Left    Speed
  0  151M    0 38608    0     0   9406      0  4:41:43  0:00:04  4:41:39  9287

  From left-to-right:
   %             - percentage completed of the whole transfer
   Total         - total size of the whole expected transfer
   %             - percentage completed of the download
   Received      - currently downloaded amount of bytes
   %             - percentage completed of the upload
   Xferd         - currently uploaded amount of bytes
   Average Speed
   Dload         - the average transfer speed of the download
   Average Speed
   Upload        - the average transfer speed of the upload
   Time Total    - expected time to complete the operation
   Time Current  - time passed since the invoke
   Time Left     - expected time left to completion
   Curr.Speed    - the average transfer speed the last 5 seconds (the first
                   5 seconds of a transfer is based on less time of course.)

  The -# option will display a totally different progress bar that doesn't
  need much explanation!

SPEED LIMIT

  Curl allows the user to set the transfer speed conditions that must be met
  to let the transfer keep going. By using the switch -y and -Y you
  can make curl abort transfers if the transfer speed is below the specified
  lowest limit for a specified time.

  To have curl abort the download if the speed is slower than 3000 bytes per
  second for 1 minute, run:

        curl -Y 3000 -y 60 www.far-away-site.com

  This can very well be used in combination with the overall time limit, so
  that the above operation must be completed in whole within 30 minutes:

        curl -m 1800 -Y 3000 -y 60 www.far-away-site.com

  Forcing curl not to transfer data faster than a given rate is also possible,
  which might be useful if you're using a limited bandwidth connection and you
  don't want your transfer to use all of it (sometimes referred to as
  "bandwidth throttle").

  Make curl transfer data no faster than 10 kilobytes per second:

        curl --limit-rate 10K www.far-away-site.com

    or

        curl --limit-rate 10240 www.far-away-site.com

  Or prevent curl from uploading data faster than 1 megabyte per second:

        curl -T upload --limit-rate 1M ftp://uploadshereplease.com

  When using the --limit-rate option, the transfer rate is regulated on a
  per-second basis, which will cause the total transfer speed to become lower
  than the given number. Sometimes of course substantially lower, if your
  transfer stalls during periods.

CONFIG FILE

  Curl automatically tries to read the .curlrc file (or _curlrc file on win32
  systems) from the user's home dir on startup.

  The config file could be made up with normal command line switches, but you
  can also specify the long options without the dashes to make it more
  readable. You can separate the options and the parameter with spaces, or
  with = or :. Comments can be used within the file. If the first letter on a
  line is a '#'-symbol the rest of the line is treated as a comment.

  If you want the parameter to contain spaces, you must enclose the entire
  parameter within double quotes ("). Within those quotes, you specify a
  quote as \".

  NOTE: You must specify options and their arguments on the same line.

  Example, set default time out and proxy in a config file:

        # We want a 30 minute timeout:
        -m 1800
        # ... and we use a proxy for all accesses:
        proxy = proxy.our.domain.com:8080

  White spaces ARE significant at the end of lines, but all white spaces
  leading up to the first characters of each line are ignored.

  Prevent curl from reading the default file by using -q as the first command
  line parameter, like:

        curl -q www.thatsite.com

  Force curl to get and display a local help page in case it is invoked
  without URL by making a config file similar to:

        # default url to get
        url = "http://help.with.curl.com/curlhelp.html"

  You can specify another config file to be read by using the -K/--config
  flag. If you set config file name to "-" it'll read the config from stdin,
  which can be handy if you want to hide options from being visible in process
  tables etc:

        echo "user = user:passwd" | curl -K - http://that.secret.site.com

EXTRA HEADERS

  When using curl in your own very special programs, you may end up needing
  to pass on your own custom headers when getting a web page. You can do
  this by using the -H flag.

  Example, send the header "X-you-and-me: yes" to the server when getting a
  page:

        curl -H "X-you-and-me: yes" www.love.com

  This can also be useful in case you want curl to send a different text in a
  header than it normally does. The -H header you specify then replaces the
  header curl would normally send. If you replace an internal header with an
  empty one, you prevent that header from being sent. To prevent the Host:
  header from being used:

        curl -H "Host:" www.server.com

FTP and PATH NAMES

  Do note that when getting files with the ftp:// URL, the given path is
  relative the directory you enter. To get the file 'README' from your home
  directory at your ftp site, do:

        curl ftp://user:passwd@my.site.com/README

  But if you want the README file from the root directory of that very same
  site, you need to specify the absolute file name:

        curl ftp://user:passwd@my.site.com//README

  (I.e with an extra slash in front of the file name.)

SFTP and SCP and PATH NAMES

  With sftp: and scp: URLs, the path name given is the absolute name on the
  server. To access a file relative to the remote user's home directory,
  prefix the file with /~/ , such as:

        curl -u $USER sftp://home.example.com/~/.bashrc

FTP and firewalls

  The FTP protocol requires one of the involved parties to open a second
  connection as soon as data is about to get transfered. There are two ways to
  do this.

  The default way for curl is to issue the PASV command which causes the
  server to open another port and await another connection performed by the
  client. This is good if the client is behind a firewall that don't allow
  incoming connections.

        curl ftp.download.com

  If the server for example, is behind a firewall that don't allow connections
  on other ports than 21 (or if it just doesn't support the PASV command), the
  other way to do it is to use the PORT command and instruct the server to
  connect to the client on the given (as parameters to the PORT command) IP
  number and port.

  The -P flag to curl supports a few different options. Your machine may have
  several IP-addresses and/or network interfaces and curl allows you to select
  which of them to use. Default address can also be used:

        curl -P - ftp.download.com

  Download with PORT but use the IP address of our 'le0' interface (this does
  not work on windows):

        curl -P le0 ftp.download.com

  Download with PORT but use 192.168.0.10 as our IP address to use:

        curl -P 192.168.0.10 ftp.download.com

NETWORK INTERFACE

  Get a web page from a server using a specified port for the interface:

        curl --interface eth0:1 http://www.netscape.com/

  or

        curl --interface 192.168.1.10 http://www.netscape.com/

HTTPS

  Secure HTTP requires SSL libraries to be installed and used when curl is
  built. If that is done, curl is capable of retrieving and posting documents
  using the HTTPS protocol.

  Example:

        curl https://www.secure-site.com

  Curl is also capable of using your personal certificates to get/post files
  from sites that require valid certificates. The only drawback is that the
  certificate needs to be in PEM-format. PEM is a standard and open format to
  store certificates with, but it is not used by the most commonly used
  browsers (Netscape and MSIE both use the so called PKCS#12 format). If you
  want curl to use the certificates you use with your (favourite) browser, you
  may need to download/compile a converter that can convert your browser's
  formatted certificates to PEM formatted ones. This kind of converter is
  included in recent versions of OpenSSL, and for older versions Dr Stephen
  N. Henson has written a patch for SSLeay that adds this functionality. You
  can get his patch (that requires an SSLeay installation) from his site at:
  http://www.drh-consultancy.demon.co.uk/

  Example on how to automatically retrieve a document using a certificate with
  a personal password:

        curl -E /path/to/cert.pem:password https://secure.site.com/

  If you neglect to specify the password on the command line, you will be
  prompted for the correct password before any data can be received.

  Many older SSL-servers have problems with SSLv3 or TLS, that newer versions
  of OpenSSL etc is using, therefore it is sometimes useful to specify what
  SSL-version curl should use. Use -3, -2 or -1 to specify that exact SSL
  version to use (for SSLv3, SSLv2 or TLSv1 respectively):

        curl -2 https://secure.site.com/

  Otherwise, curl will first attempt to use v3 and then v2.

  To use OpenSSL to convert your favourite browser's certificate into a PEM
  formatted one that curl can use, do something like this (assuming netscape,
  but IE is likely to work similarly):

    You start with hitting the 'security' menu button in netscape.

    Select 'certificates->yours' and then pick a certificate in the list

    Press the 'export' button

    enter your PIN code for the certs

    select a proper place to save it

    Run the 'openssl' application to convert the certificate. If you cd to the
    openssl installation, you can do it like:

     # ./apps/openssl pkcs12 -in [file you saved] -clcerts -out [PEMfile]


RESUMING FILE TRANSFERS

 To continue a file transfer where it was previously aborted, curl supports
 resume on http(s) downloads as well as ftp uploads and downloads.

 Continue downloading a document:

        curl -C - -o file ftp://ftp.server.com/path/file

 Continue uploading a document(*1):

        curl -C - -T file ftp://ftp.server.com/path/file

 Continue downloading a document from a web server(*2):

        curl -C - -o file http://www.server.com/

 (*1) = This requires that the ftp server supports the non-standard command
        SIZE. If it doesn't, curl will say so.

 (*2) = This requires that the web server supports at least HTTP/1.1. If it
        doesn't, curl will say so.

TIME CONDITIONS

 HTTP allows a client to specify a time condition for the document it
 requests. It is If-Modified-Since or If-Unmodified-Since. Curl allow you to
 specify them with the -z/--time-cond flag.

 For example, you can easily make a download that only gets performed if the
 remote file is newer than a local copy. It would be made like:

        curl -z local.html http://remote.server.com/remote.html

 Or you can download a file only if the local file is newer than the remote
 one. Do this by prepending the date string with a '-', as in:

        curl -z -local.html http://remote.server.com/remote.html

 You can specify a "free text" date as condition. Tell curl to only download
 the file if it was updated since January 12, 2012:

        curl -z "Jan 12 2012" http://remote.server.com/remote.html

 Curl will then accept a wide range of date formats. You always make the date
 check the other way around by prepending it with a dash '-'.

DICT

  For fun try

        curl dict://dict.org/m:curl
        curl dict://dict.org/d:heisenbug:jargon
        curl dict://dict.org/d:daniel:web1913

  Aliases for 'm' are 'match' and 'find', and aliases for 'd' are 'define'
  and 'lookup'. For example,

        curl dict://dict.org/find:curl

  Commands that break the URL description of the RFC (but not the DICT
  protocol) are

        curl dict://dict.org/show:db
        curl dict://dict.org/show:strat

  Authentication is still missing (but this is not required by the RFC)

LDAP

  If you have installed the OpenLDAP library, curl can take advantage of it
  and offer ldap:// support.

  LDAP is a complex thing and writing an LDAP query is not an easy task. I do
  advice you to dig up the syntax description for that elsewhere. Two places
  that might suit you are:

  Netscape's "Netscape Directory SDK 3.0 for C Programmer's Guide Chapter 10:
  Working with LDAP URLs":
  http://developer.netscape.com/docs/manuals/dirsdk/csdk30/url.htm

  RFC 2255, "The LDAP URL Format" http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/rfc2255.txt

  To show you an example, this is now I can get all people from my local LDAP
  server that has a certain sub-domain in their email address:

        curl -B "ldap://ldap.frontec.se/o=frontec??sub?mail=*sth.frontec.se"

  If I want the same info in HTML format, I can get it by not using the -B
  (enforce ASCII) flag.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

  Curl reads and understands the following environment variables:

        http_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY, FTP_PROXY

  They should be set for protocol-specific proxies. General proxy should be
  set with

        ALL_PROXY

  A comma-separated list of host names that shouldn't go through any proxy is
  set in (only an asterisk, '*' matches all hosts)

        NO_PROXY

  If the host name matches one of these strings, or the host is within the
  domain of one of these strings, transactions with that node will not be
  proxied.


  The usage of the -x/--proxy flag overrides the environment variables.

NETRC

  Unix introduced the .netrc concept a long time ago. It is a way for a user
  to specify name and password for commonly visited ftp sites in a file so
  that you don't have to type them in each time you visit those sites. You
  realize this is a big security risk if someone else gets hold of your
  passwords, so therefore most unix programs won't read this file unless it is
  only readable by yourself (curl doesn't care though).

  Curl supports .netrc files if told so (using the -n/--netrc and
  --netrc-optional options). This is not restricted to only ftp,
  but curl can use it for all protocols where authentication is used.

  A very simple .netrc file could look something like:

        machine curl.haxx.se login iamdaniel password mysecret

CUSTOM OUTPUT

  To better allow script programmers to get to know about the progress of
  curl, the -w/--write-out option was introduced. Using this, you can specify
  what information from the previous transfer you want to extract.

  To display the amount of bytes downloaded together with some text and an
  ending newline:

        curl -w 'We downloaded %{size_download} bytes\n' www.download.com

KERBEROS FTP TRANSFER

  Curl supports kerberos4 and kerberos5/GSSAPI for FTP transfers. You need
  the kerberos package installed and used at curl build time for it to be
  used.

  First, get the krb-ticket the normal way, like with the kinit/kauth tool.
  Then use curl in way similar to:

        curl --krb private ftp://krb4site.com -u username:fakepwd

  There's no use for a password on the -u switch, but a blank one will make
  curl ask for one and you already entered the real password to kinit/kauth.

TELNET

  The curl telnet support is basic and very easy to use. Curl passes all data
  passed to it on stdin to the remote server. Connect to a remote telnet
  server using a command line similar to:

        curl telnet://remote.server.com

  And enter the data to pass to the server on stdin. The result will be sent
  to stdout or to the file you specify with -o.

  You might want the -N/--no-buffer option to switch off the buffered output
  for slow connections or similar.

  Pass options to the telnet protocol negotiation, by using the -t option. To
  tell the server we use a vt100 terminal, try something like:

        curl -tTTYPE=vt100 telnet://remote.server.com

  Other interesting options for it -t include:

   - XDISPLOC=<X display> Sets the X display location.

   - NEW_ENV=<var,val> Sets an environment variable.

  NOTE: the telnet protocol does not specify any way to login with a specified
  user and password so curl can't do that automatically. To do that, you need
  to track when the login prompt is received and send the username and
  password accordingly.

PERSISTENT CONNECTIONS

  Specifying multiple files on a single command line will make curl transfer
  all of them, one after the other in the specified order.

  libcurl will attempt to use persistent connections for the transfers so that
  the second transfer to the same host can use the same connection that was
  already initiated and was left open in the previous transfer. This greatly
  decreases connection time for all but the first transfer and it makes a far
  better use of the network.

  Note that curl cannot use persistent connections for transfers that are used
  in subsequence curl invokes. Try to stuff as many URLs as possible on the
  same command line if they are using the same host, as that'll make the
  transfers faster. If you use a http proxy for file transfers, practically
  all transfers will be persistent.

MULTIPLE TRANSFERS WITH A SINGLE COMMAND LINE

  As is mentioned above, you can download multiple files with one command line
  by simply adding more URLs. If you want those to get saved to a local file
  instead of just printed to stdout, you need to add one save option for each
  URL you specify. Note that this also goes for the -O option (but not
  --remote-name-all).

  For example: get two files and use -O for the first and a custom file
  name for the second:

    curl -O http://url.com/file.txt ftp://ftp.com/moo.exe -o moo.jpg

  You can also upload multiple files in a similar fashion:

    curl -T local1 ftp://ftp.com/moo.exe -T local2 ftp://ftp.com/moo2.txt

IPv6

  curl will connect to a server with IPv6 when a host lookup returns an IPv6
  address and fall back to IPv4 if the connection fails. The --ipv4 and --ipv6
  options can specify which address to use when both are available. IPv6
  addresses can also be specified directly in URLs using the syntax:

    http://[2001:1890:1112:1::20]/overview.html

  When this style is used, the -g option must be given to stop curl from
  interpreting the square brackets as special globbing characters.  Link local
  and site local addresses including a scope identifier, such as fe80::1234%1,
  may also be used, but the scope portion must be numeric and the percent
  character must be URL escaped. The previous example in an SFTP URL might
  look like:

    sftp://[fe80::1234%251]/

  IPv6 addresses provided other than in URLs (e.g. to the --proxy, --interface
  or --ftp-port options) should not be URL encoded.
